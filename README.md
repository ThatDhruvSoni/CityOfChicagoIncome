# CityOfChicagoIncome

This project aims to predict the income of City of Chicago employees based on certain conditions such as their Job title, the Department they work in, whether they work Full-time, and whether they are paid Hourly or they are Salaried. Multiple regression models such as RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, SGDRegressor and a deep Artificial Neural Network (ANN) have been utilized. A mean-absolute-percentage error of 12.1% has been achieved with the RandomForestRegressor model.
